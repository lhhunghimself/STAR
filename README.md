ENHANCED FEATURES
=================

ZG/ZX BAM Tags for Enhanced Gene Annotation
--------------------------------------------
This STAR build includes custom **ZG** (gene set) and **ZX** (overlap status) BAM tags that provide comprehensive gene annotation information for each read.

**Key Features:**
- **ZG Tag**: Comma-separated list of Ensembl gene IDs overlapping each read
- **ZX Tag**: Genomic overlap status (none, exonic, intronic, spanning)  
- **Enhanced Detection**: 28% more gene annotations than standard GX tags
- **Superior Coverage**: 99.8% vs 79.2% read coverage compared to GX tags
- **Production Ready**: 100% concordance validation on large datasets

**Quick Usage:**
```bash
STAR --outSAMattributes NH HI AS nM NM CR CY UR UY GX GN gx gn ZG ZX \
     --soloFeatures Gene GeneFull \
     --soloStrand Unstranded \
     [other parameters...]
```

**Documentation:**
- [ZG/ZX Implementation Summary](docs/ZG_ZX_Implementation_Summary.md) - Complete technical documentation
- [ZG/ZX Concordance Analysis](docs/ZG_ZX_Concordance_Analysis.md) - Validation results and performance analysis
- [runSTAR.sh](runSTAR.sh) - Production script with comprehensive ZG/ZX documentation

DIRECTORY CONTENTS

  * doc: documentation
  * extras: miscellaneous files and scripts

COMPILING FROM SOURCE
=====================

Download the latest [release from](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/releases) and uncompress it
--------------------------------------------------------

```bash
# Get latest STAR source from releases
wget https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/archive/2.7.11b.tar.gz
tar -xzf 2.7.11b.tar.gz
cd STAR-2.7.11b

# Alternatively, get STAR source using git
git clone https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git
```

Compile under Linux
-------------------

```bash
# Compile
cd STAR/source
make STAR
```
For processors that do not support AVX extensions, specify the target SIMD architecture, e.g.
```
make STAR CXXFLAGS_SIMD=sse
```


Compile under Mac OS X
----------------------

```bash
# 1. Install brew (http://brew.sh/)
# 2. Install gcc with brew:
$ brew install gcc
# 3. Build STAR:
# run 'make' in the source directory
# note that the path to c++ executable has to be adjusted to its current version
$cd source
$make STARforMacStatic CXX=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/8.2.0/bin/g++-8
# 4. Make it availible through the terminal
$cp STAR /usr/local/bin
```

All platforms - non-standard gcc
--------------------------------

If g++ compiler (true g++, not Clang sym-link) is not on the path, you will need to tell `make` where to find it:
```bash
cd source
make STARforMacStatic CXX=/path/to/gcc
```

If employing STAR only on a single machine or a homogeneously setup cluster, you may aim at helping the compiler to optimize in way that is tailored to your platform. The flags LDFLAGSextra and CXXFLAGSextra are appended to the default optimizations specified in source/Makefile.
```
# platform-specific optimization for gcc/g++
make CXXFLAGSextra=-march=native
# together with link-time optimization
make LDFLAGSextra=-flto CXXFLAGSextra="-flto -march=native"
```

MEMORY TESTING
===============

For memory safety testing of STAR's tag table functionality using AddressSanitizer:

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Build with AddressSanitizer
cd source
ASAN=1 make clean
ASAN=1 make STAR

# Run memory test
cd ..
ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=1" ./mem_test_tags.sh
```

**Documentation:**
- `docs/memory_testing_guide.md` - Complete testing guide
- `docs/debug_instrumentation.md` - Debug logging and validation
- `MEMORY_TESTING.md` - Quick reference
- `asan_findings.md` - Example analysis report

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Enable debug logging and validation
STAR_DEBUG_TAG=1 ./source/STAR [options]

# Or use the debug-enabled production script
./runSTAR_debug.sh  # Comprehensive debug run with monitoring
```

**Note:** ASan builds require ~3x more RAM and run 2-5x slower than production builds.

FreeBSD ports
=============

STAR can be installed on FreeBSD via the FreeBSD ports system.
To install via the binary package, simply run:
```
pkg install star
```

LIMITATIONS
===========
This release was tested with the default parameters for human and mouse genomes.
Mammal genomes require at least 16GB of RAM, ideally 32GB.
Please contact the author for a list of recommended parameters for much larger or much smaller genomes.
